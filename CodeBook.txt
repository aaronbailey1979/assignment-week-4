From here on, all referenced files are contained in the extracted
UCI HAR Dataset heirarchy.

"subject" (character) was obtained from (what amounts to) concatenation of the subject
IDs from the data sets "subject_text.txt" and "subject_train.txt"

"activity_level" (character) is also a concatentation of the numerically coded
data sets "y_test.txt" and "y_train.txt" with language labels provided by
"activity_levels.txt"

The remaining variables are means (grouped by combinations of "subject"
and "activity_level") of those variables in the original data sets
that are themselves means or standard deviations.

The variable names of these original means and standard deviations were
extracted from the variables in "X_test.txt" and "Y_test.txt" with language
labels described in "features.txt" and "features_info.test". This was accomplished
by selecting those that had the character string "mean()" or "std()" in their name.

From here, grouped means of these variables were calculated and named by
appending "mean_of_" to the original variable. For instance,
"mean_of_tBodyAcc-mean()-X" corresponds to "tBodyAcc-mean()-X", and so on.
