A cleaning and representation of a portion of the data in
"Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0"

(We have included the original README as an addendum)

We are interested in averages (grouped by each combination of subject
and activity) of each mean-measurement and std-measurement variable.

The data in the UCI HAR Dataset is extremely well organized, and is
essentially pre-cleaned. It can be fully cleaned and prepped for our
purpose by implementing items 1) - 5) below. The code doing this is
found in the file "run_analysis.R".

We proceed thusly:
	
1) Appending the separate IDs (from "subject_test.txt" and
"subject_train.txt") and numerical activity levels (from "y_test.txt"
and "y_train.txt") with their respective test and training data sets
("X_test.txt" and "X_train.txt").

2) Assigning the descriptive labels to the variables in the original test
and training sets (from "features.txt"), and to the activity level also (via
"activity_levels.txt").

3) Merging these more descriptively labeled sets. In this
case, (as is good practice) no subject is present in both testing and
training sets, so their merger (the data set "X_merged") is simply a
concatenation of their rows.

4) We remove the variables from the merged set (other than subject
and activity level) that are not mean-calculations or std-calculations,
and group them by each combination of subject and activity level
(the data set "cut_down").

5) Finally, we compute the corresponding grouped averages, and label the
averages accordingly (the data set "final_data").

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
